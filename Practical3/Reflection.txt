This is an example file for reflection in IBI1_2024-25.

During this course, I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online!

I encountered obstacles for quite a few times during this practical. I was confused about the "git revert" command when I tried it out for the first time. 

I am wondering why I often have trouble getting accessing GitHub. Is it because I am on Ubuntu?
